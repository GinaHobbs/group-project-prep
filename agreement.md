# Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Go around the table and ask everyone's opinion on the conflict, get a mediator (make sure the mediator is a TA or a professor), be upfront, if possible solve it at the lowest level, 
**don't bash each other, no vulgarity directed at people**, don't intentionally shame people

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Pull that person aside and let them know they're taking over and to give others a chance

* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Take time to show others that are weaker in an area how to do something so you can increase their skill level

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Message that person to see if they feel the same way about it, See why they might not be contributing on a more personal level- there might be a good reason.

* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Go to Sara or a TA.

# Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
During normal school hours 9-8pm PST

* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack, Remo, Zoom

* How often will you take breaks?
As often as needed, but please be reachable during school hours

* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Catch back up!!! Ensure that tasks are divvied up if someone starts to fall behind, If necessary re-assess what's going on

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
After school hours: Slack messages - but don't expect anyone to jump on the computer
Weekend: Slack messages - but don't expect anyone to jump on the computer

If there is an emergency then we can try to resolve it as a group and get as many hands on deck as possible.

Keep everyone apprised daily of your personal hours/schedule for that day.

* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Check to see if everyone has something to say

* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
By incorporating all of the above `;)`

Trello; we'll create a project board on trello before the project

* What project management tool will be used?

Describe at least:

* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
All of them; we'll merge onto main each day
